title: This Week in Synthetic Biology
---

Every week, on Friday, I share the latest in synthetic biology research and news, in an effort to provide consistent updates on this exciting field. Inspired by [Microbiome Digest](https://microbiomedigest.com/).

**Peer-reviewed research**:

The [Delisa lab](https://www.delisaresearchgroup.com/) demonstrates new, orthogonal pathways for eukaryotic O-linked protein glycosylation in the bacterium, _E. coli_. [Read the paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0595-9).

The [Sitti](https://www.is.mpg.de/~sitti) and [Demirel](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mcd18/) labs create a biosynthetic, self-healing material using proteins found in squid teeth. [Read the paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0736-2#citeas).

- This study was covered in the news; the [Army](https://www.army.mil/article/237581/army_project_turns_to_nature_for_help_with_self_healing_material) wrote about it, as did [_The Times_](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/squid-teeth-to-help-make-self-repair-suits-c6qnxnbpq) and [other places](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS819US819&sxsrf=ALeKk01sEnys9q0lcqmuP6lsLPByD1mdfQ:1596164957319&q=self-healing+material+squid&tbm=nws&source=univ&tbo=u&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-s6LqwfbqAhXYoHIEHZfOCRoQt8YBKAF6BAgFEAY&biw=1163&bih=525).

**In the news**:

The founder/CEO of [Faber Futures](https://faberfutures.com/), Natsai Audrey Chieza, talks about fashion and synthetic biology in an inspiring interview. [Read the article](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/natsai-audrey-chieza-clothes-out-of-bacteria-interview/).
