### üß¨Featured Research

#### [CRISPR-Based Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Under One Hour](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2026172) (Open Access)

A group of scientists, led by the [Zhang](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/feng-zhang/), [Gootenberg and Abudayyeh](https://www.abugootlab.org/) labs at MIT and Harvard, have reported a rapid method to detect SARS-CoV-2 using their Cas12-based [SHERLOCK system](https://blog.addgene.org/finding-nucleic-acids-with-sherlock-and-detectr). The test returns results in less than an hour and has a sensitivity similar to reverse-transcription‚Äìquantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, the predominant method currently used to diagnose patients with COVID-19. The correspondence was published in the *New England Journal of Medicine*.

#### [CRISPR Treats a Form of Molecular Dystrophy in Mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00607-7)

Myotonic dystrophy type¬†1 (DM1) is an inherited form of muscular dystrophy, characterized by muscle wasting, weakness, clouding of the eyes, and an abnormal heartbeat. The disease is caused by ‚ÄúCTG microsatellite repeat expansions‚Äù in a specific gene, called *DMPK* (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase). Using a mouse model for DM1, a new study in *Nature Biomedical Engineering* injected viruses packaged with an RNA-targeting version of Cas9 to ‚Äúshut down‚Äù the defective repeats, effectively reversing the symptoms of DM1 in these animals.

#### [Transplanted Stem Cells Produce the Perfect Sperm](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/09/08/2010102117) (Open Access)

Farmers have been refining their breeding programs for generations, searching for the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù pig, goat, or cow. To that end, artificial insemination seems to be the perfect solution: collect sperm from males with preferred traits, and introduce that sperm into the females. A new study in *PNAS* has shown that stem cells, transplanted into mice, pigs, goats, and cattle, can produce sperm from a genetically-preferred donor. In other words, sterile males can now produce sperm with DNA from ‚Äúsuper sires‚Äù. For deeper coverage on this study, [read the article in ](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/transplanted-stem-cells-produce-sperm-in-sterilized-livestock-67936)[*The Scientist*](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/transplanted-stem-cells-produce-sperm-in-sterilized-livestock-67936)[.](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/transplanted-stem-cells-produce-sperm-in-sterilized-livestock-67936)

#### [Software Helps Design Encrypted DNA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00401)

When researchers exchange DNA‚Äîor an organism escapes from its flask‚Äîhow can we figure out where the DNA came from? DNA is cheap to manufacture, so there is a pressing need to develop encryption systems for genetic materials that can link a sequence to its creator, without being counterfeited. A new study, published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*, reports software that can create encrypted digital signatures to incorporate into a DNA plasmid. Those ‚Äúsigned‚Äù plasmids ‚Äúcan then be ordered from a DNA synthesis company or assembled from individual DNA fragments.‚Äù

#### [A Genetic Circuit Reduces Burden in Mammalian Cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18392-x) (Open Access)

Cells have limited resources. At any given moment, thousands of processes‚Äîfrom DNA replication to protein production and cellular movement‚Äîare competing for those resources. When synthetic biologists engineer a cell, typically by *adding* DNA, those resources dwindle even more. A new study in *Nature Communications* partly addresses this issue in mammalian cells, demonstrating that a genetic circuit, called an ‚Äúincoherent feedforward loop‚Äù, or iFFL, can be used to mitigate burden and ‚Äúrescue the expression level of genes of interest despite changes in available cellular resources due to the loading effects of transgene constructs‚Äù.

### üß´¬†Rapid-Fire Highlights

#### More research & reviews worth your time

* Yeast were thought to have about 700 essential genes; delete them, and the cells will die (or at least be hurt pretty badly). A [new study shows that 124 of the 700 or so ‚Äúessential‚Äù genes in yeast are actually dispensable](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209828) (*Molecular Systems Biology*). *Open Access*.
* A new [CRISPR homing gene drive spreads to every fly in a cage](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/09/11/2004373117), without any observed evolution of resistance (*PNAS*). A separate homing gene drive, with similar results, was [also published this week](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.261610v4) as a preprint (*bioRxiv*). *Open Access*.
* In cell-free systems, linear DNA is chewed up and degraded. A [new study explores enzymes that can protect linear DNA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00277), and demonstrates their utility in five different bacterial cell-free systems (*ACS Synthetic Biology*).
* How consistent can labs measure bacterial cells with optical density readings? The [new iGEM Interlab study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01127-5) takes a closer look (*Communications Biology*). *Open Access*.
* Cleveland Clinic scientists unveil a blueprint for a [cheap, automated device for culturing bacteria](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/729434v3), configured for evolution experiments. It‚Äôs so cheap, they think high school students could get one (*bioRxiv*). *Open Access*.
* Preprint from Steve Quake‚Äôs group describes a ‚Äú[low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.256545v2.abstract?%3Fcollection=)‚Äù (*bioRxiv*). *Open Access*.

* A new review explains [how to engineer encapsulins](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.27564)‚Äîcage-like protein compartments‚Äîto spatially position proteins within a cell (*Biotechnology and Bioengineering*).
* *‚ÄúSerratia symbiotica*¬†CWBI-2.3T¬†is a culturable, gut-associated bacterium‚Äù found in [blackflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bean_aphid). A new [preprint brings these bacteria to the lab](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.299214v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=), showing that they can be genetically-engineered (*bioRxiv*). *Open Access.*
* A new preprint uses [small nanobodies to bind and recruit chromatin regulators](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.290015v1.full.pdf), targeting them to specific genes in mammalian cells (*bioRxiv*). *Open Access.*.
* Scientists fawn over [GFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein), even though red fluorescent proteins have less phototoxicity and better tissue penetration. A [new study uses noncanonical amino acids to red-shift fluorescent proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0641-7) (*Nature Chemical Biology*).
* The Dunlop lab used single-cell time-lapse microscopy to [measure gene expression and growth of ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.297101v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=)[*E. coli*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.297101v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=)[ over many generations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.297101v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=); fifteen fluorescent reporters were used to track genes related to the stress response, delineating how stochastic fluctuations between cells can determine which cells live, and which die (*bioRxiv*). *Open Access*.

### üì∞ #SynBio in the News

* There was a painful abundance of misinformation about synthetic biology that circulated on Twitter this week ([leading to at least one account suspension](https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-suspends-dr-li-meng-yan-wuhan-lab-coronavirus-covid19-1532193)), especially surrounding the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a lab.
