This is the newsletter for September 4, 2020.

# Good morning.

This newsletter has changed. Research items will now be curated, non-exhaustive, and explained in a few sentences, rather than provided as a list. I will still cover peer-reviewed research, preprints, and reviews. News items, and a special bonus section, have been moved to the end of the newsletter. While I hope that this narrative format is more appealing to readers, I welcome your feedback via [direct Twitter message](https://twitter.com/NikoMcCarty).

## üß¨Featured Research

### [Biosynthesis of Plant-Based Medicines in Baker‚Äôs Yeast](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2650-9?WT.ec_id=NATURE-202009&sap-outbound-id=9D501BFD2422B7DCB2C6C76652C0372105960914) (Open¬†Access)

In a tour de force of metabolic engineering, Prashanth Srinivasan and [Christina Smolke at Stanford](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/people/christina-smolke) have engineered baker‚Äôs yeast to produce tropane alkaloids. These compounds, which are normally extracted from nightshade to treat neuromuscular disorders, were biosynthesized from starting sugars and amino acids. Constructing the synthetic pathway required more than twenty distinct proteins-taken from yeast, bacteria, plants and animals-targeted to six sub-cellular compartments, to produce the medicines. The study was published in *Nature* and has been widely covered in the media, including as a *Nature* [story](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02461-8) and in a [Stanford press release](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/09/02/scientists-turn-yeast-cells-drug-factories/).

### [Assembling 35(!) Pieces of DNA in a Single Tube](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238592) (Open¬†Access)

In 2018, I read a stunning paper by a team of scientists from [*New England Biolabs*](https://www.neb.com/) and [*Ginkgo Bioworks*](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/), describing an improvement to [Golden Gate DNA assembly](https://www.neb.com/applications/cloning-and-synthetic-biology/dna-assembly-and-cloning/golden-gate-assembly). In that paper, they described the [efficient, accurate assembly of 24 DNA fragments](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00333) in a single tube. Now, many of those same authors have built upon their prior study, reporting the routine assembly of **35 DNA fragments** in a single reaction. To optimize the system, the authors used DNA sequencing to explore possible combinations of restriction enzymes, and then ‚Äúincorporated these findings into a suite of webtools‚Äù to design more efficient DNA assembly reactions. This study was published in *PLoS One.*

### [Minicells, with Miniature Genomes, Can Build Themselves](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17863-5) (Open¬†Access)

Can a cell be built from scratch? [A lot of people think so](https://www.buildacell.org/), and they may not be far off. A new study in *Nature Communications* reports that liposomes-basically sacs of phospholipids that enclose water-can be packed and programmed with a genetic blueprint. Liposomes were packaged with a loop of DNA encoding seven different genes, together comprising a biosynthetic pathway to build phospholipids. By using ‚Äúfluorescence-based probes‚Äù, the researchers were able to ‚Äúdirectly visualize membrane incorporation of synthesized phospholipids at the single vesicle level‚Äù-in other words, miniature cells, with miniature genetic programs, can help build themselves.

### [Fine-Tuning Gene Expression in Plants](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa682/5897334#206899791) (Open¬†Access)

Promoters are short sequences of DNA upstream of a gene that play a major role in determining *how much* of a protein is produced. But the rules underpinning promoters, and a gene‚Äôs expression level, have proven difficult to unravel. This week, the [Patron lab](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/nicola-patron) reported an experimental system to rigorously investigate how different traits in a promoter-its sequence and positioning of regulatory elements, for example-impact the expression level of a gene. With these findings, a suite of ‚Äúminimal‚Äù promoters were developed that can be used to more precisely tune a gene‚Äôs output. The study was published in *Nucleic Acids Research*. Read the [press release from the Earlham Institute](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/newsroom/ei%E2%80%99s-synthetic-biology-team-rewrites-rules-plant-gene-expression).

### [Software Package Simplifies Inter-Lab Measurements](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00296) (Open¬†Access)

The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, or [iGEM](https://igem.org/Main_Page), has brought together young synthetic biology students for nearly two decades. A cornerstone of that competition is the [measurement ](https://2020.igem.org/Measurement)lab, whereby students carefully measure engineered cells and report their results to study how those measurements differ across laboratories and devices. A new study, in *ACS Synthetic Biology*, builds upon the dire need for standardization in synthetic biology, offering a software tool (written for R) that can calibrate fluorescent and plate reader measurements.

## üß´ Rapid-Fire Highlights

### More research & reviews worth your¬†time

* The first [eukaryotic MAGE method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417312564) was published in *Cell* in 2017, but improvements are finally here. The [new version](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.256743v1.full.pdf) of MAGE, which can be used to implement many edits to a genome simultaneously, improved ‚Äúediting frequencies up to 90%, reduced workflow time by 40%‚Äù and lowered ‚Äúthe rate of spontaneous mutations ‚àº17-fold‚Äù. It‚Äôs basically genome editing on steroids ( *bioRxiv*). ***Open Access.***
* A [CRISPR-based ‚Äúchromosome drive‚Äù in yeast](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18222-0) has been used to remove a synthetic chromosome X via a single, double-strand break in the DNA. A wild-type chromosome X, harboring a fluorescent protein or an entire biosynthetic pathway, was then duplicated by sexual reproduction, demonstrating that chromosome drives can be used to selectively transmit genetic information in yeast ( *Nature Communications*). ***Open Access.***
* A [CRISPR-based transcriptional repressor has been implemented in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-020-0563-3) to modulate the immune system. Repression of a gene called *Myd88* ‚Äúcan act as a prophylactic measure against septicaemia in both Cas9 transgenic and C57BL/6J mice‚Äù ( *Nature Cell Biology*).
* By deregulating central metabolism in *E. coli* with CRISPRi and targeted proteolysis, the Lynch lab at Duke was able to more [scale up the production of ‚Äúalanine, citramalate and xylitol, from microtiter plates to pilot reactors‚Äù](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.274290v1), with engineered bacteria ( *bioRxiv*). ***Open Access.***
* A new review on the [molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas bacterial immunity](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-genet-022120-112523) was published by Nussenzweig & Maraffini ( *Annual Review of Genetics*). Another review espoused the promise of [*anti-CRISPR* proteins for building gene circuits](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2020.575393/abstract) ( *Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology*).
* The Church lab is using [machine learning to guide protein engineering efforts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.917682v2). In a new preprint, they claim that ‚Äúas few as 24 functionally assayed mutant sequences‚Äù can be used ‚Äúto build an accurate virtual fitness landscape‚Äù ( *bioRxiv*). ***Open Access.***
* [DNA origami nanostructures are used to ‚Äúview‚Äù objects](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.271072v1) with nanometer-scale resolution. The method can write *distances* into DNA molecules, and use sequencing to reveal the geometry of tiny, molecular geometries ( *bioRxiv*). ***Open Access.***
* An intriguing [review on gene delivery for the skin](https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799%2820%2930207-9#%20) was published. As companies like [Azitra](https://azitrainc.com/technology/) look to engineer the skin microbiome, viral delivery methods may not be the best option ( *Trends in Biotechnology*). ***Open Access***\*\*.\*\*
* *Caulobacter* cells were engineered to secrete an extracellular matrix protein fused to SpyCatcher, enabling ‚Äú [programmable extracellular protein matrices](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.276303v1.full.pdf)‚Äù ( *bioRxiv*). ***Open Access***\*\*.\*\*
* A [full issue on yeast synthetic biology](https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/issue/20/6) was printed, featuring articles on mitochondrial engineering, converting starch to ethanol, and transposable elements in baker‚Äôs yeast ( *FEMS Yeast Research*).
* If you want to release GMOs into the wild, you‚Äôll want to consider how to *stop* them if they grow out of control. A new study swapped codons in *E. coli* to create a [‚Äúgenetic firewall‚Äù that prevents leakage](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00196) of engineered DNA into the environment ( *ACS Synthetic Biology*).
