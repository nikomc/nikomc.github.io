My name is Niko McCarty, and this is a vain attempt to encapsulate my interests in a few lines of text. I'm currently an M.A. student at New York University, where I study science journalism. As a data analyst, programmer and journalist, my goal is to tell captivating science stories by blending narratives with visualizations. 

I hold an M.S. in Bioengineering from the California Institute of Technology[^1] and a MRes in Systems and Synthetic Biology from Imperial College London, where I was a Fulbright scholar.

I hold a Master of Science (MS) in Bioengineering from <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a> (California Institute of Technology), where I worked with Rob Phillips, and I hold a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.ledesma-amaro">Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ellis">Tom Ellis</a> on methods for gRNA multiplexing and metabolic pathway rewiring in yeast. I received my Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/biochemistry/">Biochemistry</a> from the <a href="https://uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>, where I researched diabetes and the insulin signaling pathway in transgenic mouse models with <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/e-dale-abel">E. Dale Abel</a>.<br><br>

I am a voracious reader and enjoy digging into my research data with Python, and making data visualizations with D3.js<br><br>

## Lists
### Unordered Lists

The HTML &lt;ul&gt; element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

Usage notes:
* The &lt;ul&gt; element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared.
* There is no limitation to the depth and alternation of nested lists defined with the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements.
* The &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the &lt;ol&gt; element, the order is meaningful.

### Ordered Lists

The HTML &lt;ol&gt; element represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list.

Usage notes:
1. Typically, ordered-list items are displayed with a preceding numbering, which can be of any form, like numerals, letters or Romans numerals or even simple bullets.
2. There is no limitation to the depth and alternation of nested lists defined with the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements.
3. The &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; both represent a list of items. They differ in the way that, with the &lt;ol&gt; element, the order is meaningful.

## Footnotes

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog[^2].

[^1]: Foxes are red
[^2]: Dogs are usually not red

Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.
