My name is Niko McCarty, and this is a vain attempt to encapsulate my interests in a few lines of text. I'm currently an M.A. journalism student in the SHERP program at New York University. As a programmer, journalist, and former synthetic biologist, my goal is to share science with others by blending stories with static and interactive data visualizations. 

I hold an M.S. in Bioengineering from the California Institute of Technology[^1] and a MRes in Systems and Synthetic Biology from Imperial College London[^2], where I was a Fulbright scholar. I've published peer-reviewed articles on new CRISPR technologies, multiplexed guide RNAs, and engineered microbial communities.
