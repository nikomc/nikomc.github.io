# Good morning. This week‚Ä¶

The EPA has approved [Oxitec‚Äôs plan to release genetically-engineered mosquitoes](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33658014/genetically-modified-mosquitoes-release-florida/) into the Florida keys, the [Netflix show "Biohackers‚Äù](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/biohackers-netflix-review) received mixed reviews, WIRED wrote about a [clump of bacteria](https://www.wired.com/story/a-ball-of-bacteria-survived-for-3-years-in-space/) that survived in space for three years, and Katherine Wu wrote about ‚Äú[predatory bacteria](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/science/bacteria-bdellovibrio-predator-prey.html)‚Äù that hunt and eat living cells. As if microbes, in the middle of a pandemic, weren‚Äôt scary enough!

Desiree Ho, a student at UC-Berkeley, wrote a fantastic article about the intersection of [gene editing, paper, and art](https://news.berkeley.edu/story_jump/crispaper-understanding-gene-editing-through-art/) (check out the video; it‚Äôs worth your time), *Popular Mechanics* separated [genetic engineering facts from fiction](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33795705/genetic-engineering-in-popular-sci-fi/), Harris-Stowe State University will develop a [Biotechnology Certificate program](https://www.kbia.org/post/harris-stowe-receives-342000-federal-grant-help-students-prepare-stem-careers#stream/0) after receiving 342 thousand dollars from the NSF, and Ian Simon, a former biosecurity and biodefense policy analyst, was interviewed for [Titus Talks](https://medium.com/bioeconomy-xyz/what-do-korea-whiskey-science-policy-and-the-white-house-have-in-common-809b403e9d17).

In industry news, [Synthego raised 100M dollars](https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/26/synthego-raises-100-million-for-ai-driven-gene-editing/) for AI-driven gene editing, an open letter called on [Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods to ditch GMO products](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysplitter/2020/08/25/lightlife-letter-impossible-beyond/#30ea1c972b65) (my bet: not going to happen), and *TechCrunch* wrote about [investments in synthetic biology](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/synthetic-biology-startups-ride-a-wave-of-investor-interest/) companies.

## üß¨This week¬†in research‚Ä¶

[**A Cas13-Based Assay Detects SARS-CoV-2**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00603-x) **(Open Access)**

Tests for SARS-CoV-2‚Äîthe coronavirus behind the disease COVID-19‚Äîcould use some help. Now, a large team from the Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have developed a [SHERLOCK](https://sherlock.bio/) assay (which uses the Cas13 protein) to detect the RNA in SARS-CoV-2. The researchers collected 154 nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples from Siriraj Hospital, in Thailand, and showed that the assay ‚Äúwas 100% specific and 100% sensitive with a fluorescence readout.‚Äù It could detect as little as 42 RNA copies of the virus. The study was published in *Nature Biomedical Engineering*.

[**Multiplexed Genome Editing in Fruit Flies**](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/24/2004655117) **(Open Access)**

The [Boutros lab](https://www.dkfz.de/en/signaling/boutros_en.html) at Heidelberg University has, for the first time, used Cas12a to edit the fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) genome. Until now, scientists had only been able to use Cas9. The authors demonstrated that Cas12a from *Lachnospiraceae bacterium*‚Äîbut not *Acidaminococcus‚Äî*were functional in the flies, and that the editing efficiency of the Cas12a protein could be tuned with temperature (with 29¬∞C being the optimal). They were able to target up to 8 genes at once from a single crRNA array, and concluded the paper by reporting a mutated version of the Cas12a protein (D156R) with an improved editing efficiency. The study was published in *PNAS*.

[**Malaria Mosquito Gets Gene Drive Upgrade** ](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/19/2010214117)**(Open Access)**

In mosquito-related news, the [James lab](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=2154) at UC-Irvine has developed a Cas9/guide RNA-based gene drive for *Anopheles gambiae*, one of the main species that transmit malaria. The new gene drive, which was reported in *PNAS*, targets the *cardinal* gene that encodes the red-eye phenotype. The gene drive spread to at least 98% of a population‚Äîboth males and females‚Äîafter only 6 to 10 generations in a cage trials, and mosquitoes resistant to the gene drive appeared at a frequency of less than 0.1%.

[**An Intercellular Signaling Toolbox for Cell‚ÄìCell Communication**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17993-w) **(Open Access)**

Researchers at the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.im.cas.cn/pe/fas/) have created an intercellular signaling ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù that enables engineered cells to communicate with one another with minimal crosstalk. The work, published in *Nature Communications*, includes ‚Äúbiosynthesis gene clusters‚Äù that are used to build small signaling molecules within the cells, along with a suite of evolved transcription factors and engineered promoters, to increase the signal efficiency. The team demonstrated their ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù in both yeast and human cells, performing complex bio-computations with up to seven engineered strains.

[**Baker Lab Creates ‚ÄòDesigner‚Äô Transmembrane Pores**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2646-5)

At the University of Washington‚Äôs [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/), the papers never seem to stop. In another tour de force of computational protein design, the Baker lab has created transmembrane protein pores‚Äîmade from concentric rings of Œ±-helices‚Äîwith a high selectivity for specific ions or molecules. A pore with 12 Œ±-helices had a high selectivity for potassium ions, compared to sodium ions, while a pore with 16 Œ±-helices enabled selective passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488, a type of fluorescent dye. The study, published in *Nature*, could open the door for a range of designer channels and pores, with major applications for artificial cells.

[**Cell-Free System Produces Cannabinoids**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0631-9)

Why grow cannabis‚Äîand pay the exorbitant energy bills‚Äîwhen you could crack open some cells and use enzymes instead? The [Bowie lab](https://bowielab.mbi.ucla.edu/) at the [UCLA-DOE](https://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/) Institute has created a cell-free system to produce cannabinoids; only 12 enzymes were needed to convert cheap, organic acids into cannabigerolic acid or cannabigerovarinic acid at a titer of about 0.5 grams per liter. That‚Äôs nearly two orders of magnitude higher than yeast-based production. The study, published in *Nature Chemical Biology*, could replace extraction of cannabinoids from plants in the future.
