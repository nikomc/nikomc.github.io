When I was studying for my PhD in bioengineering at Caltech, I took a course on data analysis. It was basically Python 101; we learned about Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, HoloViews, and all the other fun libraries that help scientists collect, clean, tidy, and visualize data. At the time, I had no idea that "data visualization" was a viable career path, even though the part of my research that I most enjoyed was analyzing data -- not collecting it.

More recently, I learned D3.js, Vega-Lite, and other JavaScript-based plotting libraries. I practice programming every day, and finish a small data project every week that blends my skills in Python and JavaScript; I typically build web scrapers to collect data with Python, clean the data with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), explore the data with [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), and then build data visualizations for the web with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) or [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) with React. I'm comfortable with SQL, Python, JavaScript, D3.js, Vega-Lite, React, CSS/Sass, and HTML.

My dream job is to be an investigative science/data journalist, and blend deep reporting with visual creations that help readers explore, and understand, complex subjects.
