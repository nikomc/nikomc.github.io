When I was studying for my PhD in bioengineering at Caltech, I took a course on data analysis. It was basically Python 101; we learned about Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, HoloViews, and all the other fun libraries that help scientists collect, clean, tidy, and visualize data. At the time, I had no idea that "data visualization" was a viable career path, even though the part of my research that I most enjoyed was analyzing data -- not collecting it.

During my PhD, I began to learn D3.js, Vega-Lite, and other JavaScript-based plotting libraries. I try to practice every day, and finish a small data project every week that blends my skills in Python and JavaScript.

You can view my data visualizations on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@nikomccarty). I also run a weekly [data blog for Scienceline](https://scienceline.org), where I explore and explain scientific concepts through data visualizations.

My dream job is to be an investigate science/data journalist, and blend deep reporting with visual creations that help readers explore, and understand, complex subjects.
