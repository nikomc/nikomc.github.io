### Good morning. This week…

*Undark* considered how [gene editing could make meatier cows](https://undark.org/2020/08/05/biotechnology-cattle-industry/), *STAT* [hosted a virtual CRISPR event](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/05/virtual-event-crisprs-forward-march/) with Alexis Thompson and David Liu, *Massive Science* [drew parallels between cultivated meat and Tesla Roadsters](https://massivesci.com/articles/cultivated-meat-revolution/), and researchers at the University of New England [sexed chickens from feather DNA](http://www.poultryhub.org/a-fast-and-accurate-sexing-method-developed-at-the-university-of-new-england-to-sex-chickens-using-feather-crude-dna/).

Meanwhile, an [article in ](https://theecologist.org/2020/aug/03/gene-editing-and-sustainable-farming)[*The Ecologist*](https://theecologist.org/2020/aug/03/gene-editing-and-sustainable-farming) mentioned that the UK government is “considering the deregulation of genome-edited organisms in agriculture”. [A press release](https://around.uoregon.edu/content/knight-campus-scientist-boosts-strength-genetic-synthesis) from the University of Oregon highlighted the new [Plesa lab](http://www.plesalab.org/) and [DropSynth 2.0](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa600/5874357), WIRED [published a “CRISPR guide,”](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-crispr/) and [Axios spoke with Jennifer Doudna](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-pandemic-gene-editing-crispr-42a48f54-1c8a-4ae2-b5bf-c422f45603d3.html) about CRISPR and coronavirus diagnostics.

In industry news, [Carisma](https://carismatx.com/) can proceed with a Phase 1 trial after [all-clear for engineered macrophage immunotherapy](https://synbiobeta.com/carisma-therapeutics-announces-fda-clearance-of-ind-application-for-first-ever-engineered-macrophage-immunotherapy/), Ginkgo [announced their 2020 creative residents](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/2020/08/03/introducing-our-2020-creative-residents/), and *Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News* [published a piece](https://www.genengnews.com/insights/crispr-startups-give-genome-editing-several-new-twists/) on companies using base editors, exonucleases, and other gene-editing tools.

In coronavirus testing news, UC Davis scientists [received a $1.2M NIH grant](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/nih-grant-create-humanized-mice-susceptible-covid-19) to “create mice that are susceptible to the COVID-19 virus,” Oxford Nanopore [launched LamPORE](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/oxford-nanopore-technologies-partners-uk-government-roll-out-lampore-new-generation), and [Ginkgo](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/), [Mammoth](https://mammoth.bio/), and others were [among winners of $250M NIH award](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/31/nih-shark-tank-covid-19-testing-ginkgo-mammoth/) to scale up COVID-19 testing.

### This week in research…

[**Controlling Engineered T-cells with Ultrasound**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00238)

In the latest work from the [Shapiro lab](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*, T-cells with engineered heat shock promoters were controlled “[with brief pulses of heat delivered by focused ultrasound](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/),” inducing them to release cytokines and target tumor cells.

[**Automated Genetic Circuit Design for Yeast**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0757-2)

At MIT, the [Voigt lab](http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/) has constructed nine NOT/NOR gates, with a 400-fold dynamic range, in *S. cerevisiae*. With these gates in hand, they then used Cello 2.0, a software to design genetic circuits, to “build circuits with up to 11 regulatory proteins.” The study could dramatically simplify circuit design for eukaryotic synthetic biology, and was published in *Nature Microbiology*.

[**Automated Cell Culture System with DIY Hardware**](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000794) **(Open Access)**

With some printed circuit boards and off-the-shelf components, costing about \$300, a [team at Oxford](http://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/User:Antonis) has created a cell culture automation system with several useful features; the device can measure and record cell growth, and the seven-color LEDs can be used to measure multiple fluorescent proteins in parallel, or for optogenetics. The system, called Chi.Bio, was published in *PLoS Biology*.

For more on this study, [check out my interview](https://medium.com/bioeconomy-xyz/automated-biology-is-now-an-affordable-reality-753684775521) with the lead author, Dr. Harrison Steel.

[**Phase Separation in Human Cells with “Designer” Disordered Proteins**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0511-7)

The [Chilkoti lab](https://bme.duke.edu/faculty/ashutosh-chilkoti) at Duke University has designed a set of artificial, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that can be used to engineer intracellular condensates in living cells. In a new study, published in *Nature Chemistry*, they show that the behavior of the engineered condensates are predictable, and can be tuned by controlling the mass and structure of the IDPs. Chilkoti said in a [Duke press release](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/idp-organelles) that this study “provides very simple engineering principles to program this behavior \[intracellular condensates\] within a cell.”

[**Chemicals Stymie CRISPR Gene Drives**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00117)

At [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), in Seoul, South Korea, the [Kim lab](https://sites.google.com/site/hyongbumkimlab/professor) has developed a chemical method to control CRISPR-based gene drives in *Drosophila* fruit flies. Using a site-specific recombinase induced by a chemical, called RU486, they demonstrate a gene drive removal rate of 7-12\% in each generation. The work was published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*.
