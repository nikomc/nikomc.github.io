Evolution has the extraordinary ability to devise multiple solutions to a single problem. In the dense forests of Papua New Guinea, a male bird of paradise ([_Lophorina superba_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w.pdf)) approaches a potential mate, puffs out its chest, and spreads its feathers into an intimidating fan. Its ultra-black feathers are accentuated with a deep shade of green, made to impress the onlooking female. The _superba_’s plumage is such a deep black that it absorbs up to 99.95% of all light, on par with the darkest materials ever studied.

Now hop a few islands west, to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, where the _Rajah Brooke’s Birdwing_, a butterfly, touts wings with a similar shade of black. First documented by Alfred Russell Wallace in 1855, it was only recently that scientists analyzed the ultra-black _Birdwing_, which reflects [less than 0.3% of incident light](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15033-1.pdf) at certain wavelengths.

Though these creatures share “ultra-black” features, that is also where their similarities end. Ultra-black butterflies achieve their coloration via two layers of thin, honeycomb structures on their wings, which effectively trap light. Birds of paradise, conversely, scatter and deflect light via tiny filaments that project from their feathers. According to a [2018 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w.pdf), this works for the ultra-black birds because “each time light scatters at a surface interface, a proportion of that light is transmitted into the material, where it can be absorbed. By increasing the number of times light scatters, structurally absorbing materials can increase total light absorption to produce a profoundly black appearance.”

For several years, the unique, ultra-black coloration of these creatures appeared to be confined to the land and the skies, mainly in the south Pacific islands. That is, until a 17-day fishing expedition led to the discovery of another ultra-black creature, hiding in the ocean’s depths, that could have the serendipitous benefit of helping scientists find novel ways to improve solar cells and create highly-sensitive telescopes.

"Targeting fish with a trawl is 10% knowing where to sample and 90% luck,” says Alex Davis, lead author on a [new study](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30860-5.pdf) in the journal _Communications Biology_, in which 16 species of fish with ultra-black coloration were reported.

Davis, a graduate student at Duke University, has worked with ultra-black animals before. Just a few months ago, he [published a study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15033-1.pdf) on ten ultra-black butterflies in the prestigious journal _Nature Communications_, and demonstrated “that butterflies produce ultra-black by creating a sparse material with high surface area to increase absorption and minimize surface reflection”.

But Davis’ decision to study ultra-black butterflies and fish was not intentional.

“To make a long story short, I did not know that I wanted to work on ultra-black animals when I got to graduate school. It almost happened by accident,” said Davis. “Before I joined the lab, I saw [Sonke Johnsen](https://biology.duke.edu/people/sonke-johnsen) give a talk on the first of these black fishes and wanted to work on something adjacent to that in biophotonics more broadly. Another faculty member in our department had some butterflies that he thought were exceptionally black and suggested that I take a look at them. That kicked off the whole thing.”

After reading about these ultra-black fish, I became curious; how did Davis know where to look for them? With seven vast oceans to explore, the task seemed utterly hopeless.

“As far as collecting and finding animals goes — it’s a total crapshoot,” said Davis. “We suspected that ultra-black was common enough that we could sample relatively deep in the water column (500m — 2000m) and capture at least a handful. We had plenty of empty trawls, but at the end of 17 days we collected a much larger diversity of species than expected.”

After collecting the fish, the team returned to the lab to answer a series of questions; how did these fish achieve ultra-black coloration, and _why_? Fish do not have honeycomb structures like some butterflies, nor light-scattering feathers like the birds of paradise.

The researchers suspected that an unknown biological mechanism might be at play, and so they analyzed the skin from nine different ultra-black fish. They found that each species possessed a layer of melanosomes — cellular structures that contain melanin, a dark pigment — that can absorb up to 99.95% of light. That makes these fish as dark as Vantablack, one of the blackest synthetic materials in existence.

While other fish do have melanosomes, the ultra-black species arrange these pigment-packed structures into a dense layer, with very few unpigmented gaps. But the question remains: why did ultra-black fish evolve a dense layer of melanosomes in the first place?

The answer may lie in how predators hunt in the dark depths of the ocean.

According to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/light_travel.html) (NOAA), light in the ocean does not penetrate more than 1,000 meters. At this depth, some predators hunt with bioluminescent flashes, in which a bit of light is emitted and the reflected photons are used to detect and catch unsuspecting prey.

Suspecting that ultra-black features could protect fish from being eaten, Davis and colleagues used a computational model to determine how far predators could see prey with varying shades of “ultra-black” skin. They found that, by reducing skin reflectance from 2% to 0.05%, the sighting distance of a fish decreased by about 6-fold. That’s a huge evolutionary benefit, and may explain how these ultra-black fish escape detection in the deep ocean.

Though these ultra-black creatures — butterflies, birds, and now fish — achieve their striking coloration in different ways, each of them could help engineers develop improved solar cells and more sensitive telescopes for deep-space observation.

To improve the light-capturing efficiency of solar cells, for example, American and German scientists previously developed [“biophotonic nanostructures”](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/3/10/e1700232.full.pdf) that mimicked the honeycomb structures found on the wings of ultra-black butterflies. And just last year, MIT scientists developed a material that reflects ten times less light than even Vantablack. According to an [MIT press release](http://news.mit.edu/2019/blackest-black-material-cnt-0913#:~:text=In%20a%20scientific%20development%20inspired,into%20space,%E2%80%9D%20writes%20Osborne.), these super black materials can be used in “optical blinders that reduce unwanted glare, to help space telescopes spot orbiting exoplanets.”

Unfortunately, the best man-made, ultra-black materials rely on vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes, which are difficult to manufacture. As [Davis told WIRED magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/meet-the-ultra-black-vantafish/), ultra-black melanosomes could help engineers searching for new, ultra-black materials because “there’s no special structural alignment that you need. In theory, if you can make nanoparticles of the right size and shape, then you should be able to just coat anything with it.”

In other words, nature has bestowed the gift of ultra-black coloration on many different animals. It helps birds attract mates and camouflages fish from hungry predators in the ocean. Now, this same gift could help scientists develop enhanced technologies to capture the sun and map the stars.
