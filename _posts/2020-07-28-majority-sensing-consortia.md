What makes a community, like the [Lower East Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_East_Side) of Manhattan, so vibrant? Perhaps it is the Punjabi, Ethiopian, and Japanese restaurants dotted throughout the streets, serving up delicious dishes, or the middle-aged woman teetering on a unicycle 8-feet in the air, or the crowds that gather about chess tables and taunt competitors in thick, New York accents.

The same themes found in the vibrant communities of New York - of diversity, quirkiness, and tension - are [also at play within our guts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00193-3), home to [about 1,000 microbial species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667473/#:~:text=The%20human%20intestinal%20tract%20harbours,human%20genome%20%5BLey%20et%20al.). In fact, microbes live all over and within our bodies; about [100 trillion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050011/#:~:text=The%20human%20gut%20harbors%20diverse,influence%20the%20development%20of%20disease.) microbial cells coat our skin with an invisible armor, feast on the sugars upon our teeth, and swirl about in the chaotic churning of our guts. These minuscule, microbial neighborhoods, though largely helpful, can also be associated with severe disease.

For decades, studies have espoused the _correlation_ between our outward-appearing health and inward-facing gut microbiome. Taking a dose of antibiotics or changing the foods we eat for  a [_single day_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050011/) can skew the populations of different bacterial species in our guts - sometimes referred to as our "forgotten organ" - in quite dramatic ways. [Many studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933040/) have shown that obesity and type 2 diabetes is associated with an elevated number of [_Firmicutes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmicutes#:~:text=The%20Firmicutes%20(Latin:%20firmus,,them%20to%20stain%20gram-negative.) bacteria, for example. An imbalance in the gut microbiome has also been associated with a plethora of disease, including "[autoimmune and allergic diseases, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050011/)."

There is hope that restoring bacterial populations to a "healthy" state could be used to treat, or stave off, disease. [Researchers have been testing fecal transplants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974513/), in which the stool from a healthy person is inserted into a patient, to treat Crohn's disease. But this approach is a bit like using a [nuclear bomb to shut off a gas leak](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127473704#:~:text=News%20reports%20from%20Russia%20say,well%20under%20tons%20of%20earth.). It would be far better if scientists and physicians had a more targeted way to control the microbial species in these complex environments, much as a baker concocts and refines a recipe.

[A new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17475-z), from bioengineers at Rice University, has demonstrated that, by engineering cells with genetic circuits, the members of a microbial community can talk to one another and coordinate behaviors at the molecular level. The results mark a promising advancement in the synthetic control of microbial communities, and may prove useful in future efforts to modify the microbiome.

First, a crash course on bacterial communication. Bacteria talk to one another by producing and sensing chemical signals in their environments. By sensing which molecules are nearby, a bacterial species is able to evade foes, collaborate with friends, and communicate with neighbors. The molecule secreted by a given bacterial species is much like a telephone number - it helps a cell identify, and be identified. This "bacterial language" is called quorum sensing, and was largely pioneered through initial work by [J. Woodland Hastings](https://www.pnas.org/content/104/3/693) at Harvard, and ongoing work by [Bonnie Bassler](https://scholar.princeton.edu/basslerlab/publications-0) at Princeton.

If bacteria talk to one another by secreting and sensing chemicals in their environment, could  bioengineers hijack these signals to control bacterial communities?

A new study, published in the journal _Nature Communications_, says "yes".

Led by Dr. Razan Alnahhas, the study reports a "majority-sensing" consortium, in which two strains of _E. coli_ (a specific type of bacterium found in our intestines) were engineered to talk with, and control, one another.

Inspired by the same types of circuits operating in our phones and laptops, Alnahhas and colleagues built "…a consortium in which [quorum sensing] molecules are used to adjust gene expression at the single-cell level in response to the ratio of strains within the consortium."

To do that, one strain was engineered to produce a _blue_ fluorescent protein, while the other was engineered to produce a _yellow_ fluorescent protein. Then, each bacterium - blue and yellow - was engineered to secrete a unique, chemical signal that could be detected by the other strain. When blue detects a signal from yellow (and vice versa), the signal enters the cell, binds to a protein, and shuts down the molecular machinery needed to produce the signal. In this way, blue inhibits yellow, and yellow inhibits blue, in a co-repressive dance of molecular proportions.

When the researchers mixed the two strains together, they repeatedly demonstrated a "majority-wins" result. In other words, if an experiment began with more blue cells in the mixture, then those cells would produce more of the blue signal and shut down the yellow signals, and vice versa.

But why is a community of talkative cells useful in the first place?

By building "land lines" between cells in a community, researchers in the future may be able to tweak and correct out-of-control bacteria in our guts. According to Alnahhas and colleagues, one could possibly implement a population control switch by encoding a toxin in each of the cells. The authors state  that "if a strain begins to overgrow and become a majority, the toxin could be expressed and reduce the growth rate of this strain until a balance is reached again." To test this idea, more studies will need to be conducted.

Still, a genetic circuit for precisely controlling microbial populations within a community could be a boon for clinicians hoping to modify the gut microbiome. And the idea of placing a genetically-engineered cell into our bodies is not as dystopian as you might think - scientists have already done it.

One Cambridge-based spin-out company, called [SynLogic](https://www.synlogictx.com/), has been developing "living therapeutics" - cells that have been genetically-engineered to treat disease - for years. Using genetic engineering, the company has programmed cells to treat everything from IBD to lymphoma and [phenylketonuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria), an inherited genetic condition that causes a dangerous accumulation of phenylalanine, an amino acid, in the blood and brain. Some of these "living medicines", including the one for phenylketonuria, have already made it to Phase 1 clinical trials, and the results were published in the journal [_Nature Biotechnology_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4222) in late 2018. Still, living medicines are a long way from widespread clinical adoption.

Though living medicines hold promise for many diseases, these treatments have, thus far, been confined to individual bacterial species. It is much easier to engineer a single bacterium than an entire community. If, however, scientists and doctors truly hope to control the complex communities living within our guts, then they must learn to program these communities as a whole, rather than as parts. To build a vibrant community, one must understand all of the players. Then, perhaps in the distant future, doctors can play as "microbiome bakers", tweaking ingredients and perfecting recipes to create healthier guts.
