### Good morning. This week…

*The New Yorker’s* Raffi Khatchadourian [wrote about Jackson Laboratory’s rapid shipments](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/can-designer-mice-save-us-from-covid-19) of “designer mice” for SARS-CoV-2 research, *NewScientist* [covered a “radical new theory”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24732940-800-a-radical-new-theory-rewrites-the-story-of-how-life-on-earth-began/) on how life began on Earth, and *CNN’s* Milly Chan [wrote a feature](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/colorifix-sustainable-dyeing-water-pollution-spc-intl/index.html) on [Colorifix](https://colorifix.com/)’s dyeing of fabrics with synthetic biology.

Meanwhile, the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote about how proteins engineered to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 could [soon show up in nose sprays](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/Fake-molecules-in-nose-spray-will-keep-the-15476742.php), [*OneZero*](https://onezero.medium.com/the-first-gene-edited-squid-in-history-is-a-biological-breakthrough-c81cb0449e5a) and [*Science Friday*](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/squid-gene-editing/) covered the first genetic edit in a squid, and Sarah Katz wrote a brilliant piece for Discover Magazine [explaining why some deaf people oppose a CRISPR cure](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/why-deaf-people-oppose-using-gene-editing-to-cure-deafness).

In industry news, [Sherlock Biosciences](https://sherlock.bio/) [announced a collaboration](https://synbiobeta.com/sherlock-biosciences-announces-research-collaboration-with-dartmouth-hitchcock-health-to-launch-study-of-crispr-based-test-for-sars-cov-2/) to launch CRISPR-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 and [Mammoth Biosciences](https://mammoth.bio/) [inked a deal for Doudna lab’s “miniature” Cas enzyme](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2020/08/12/mammoth-biosciences-signs-exclusive-deal-for-recently-discovered-crispr-protein/#3ec75cf27c0e), CasΦ.

Congratulations to Northwestern’s Center for Synthetic Biology on a [$3 million grant from the NSF.](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2020/08/national-science-foundation-grant-opens-new-doors-for-center-for-synthetic-biology.html)

Today is the deadline for **iGEM teams** to [register for the virtual ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNu98gfs3--8vOCQeTAgrh7G3rCkP3URZoDgGbx4JxGonkmQ/viewform)[*MIT Mammalian Meetup*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNu98gfs3--8vOCQeTAgrh7G3rCkP3URZoDgGbx4JxGonkmQ/viewform), which will be held on August 27th from 9-12 EDT, featuring keynote speaker [Ron Weiss](https://be.mit.edu/directory/ron-weiss).

### This week in research…

[**Listening to the Music of a Cell**](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl_a_00325?journalCode=artl)

[Eduardo Reck Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Reck_Miranda) is a professor of computer music at the University of Plymouth. In his latest paper, he introduces “a system for music composition informed by synthetic biology”, in which music is generated via simulations of various cellular processes, including transcription and protein folding. The study was published in *Artificial Life*.


[***E. coli*** ](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30875-8#articleInformation)[**Engineered to Grow Solely on Methanol**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30875-8#articleInformation) *(They must be starving!)*

At UCLA, the [Liao lab](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/liao_lab/) has engineered *E. coli* to utilize methanol as its sole carbon source. With a paltry doubling time of 8.5 hours, the team began by using “metabolic robustness criteria” to engineer the strain, followed by laboratory evolution, and found that the final organism carefully balanced metabolic flux by tuning gene copy numbers and mutating key enzymes. The work was published in *Cell*.


[**Going Deeeep on the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31003-5) **(Open Access)**

[Researchers](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in Seattle, have performed a deep-mutational scan on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), the bit that binds to ACE2 on human cells. They created every single amino-acid substitution in the RBD, and show that, while most mutations are deleterious, some mutations enhance affinity for ACE2. The work was published in *Cell*.


[**Boosting Photosynthesis in Plants**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-0740-1)

At the University of Essex, the [Raines lab](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/raine84508/christine-raines) inserted multiple genes, from red algae and cyanobacteria, into *Nicotiana tabacum* (tobacco) to stimulate both electron transport and Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate turnover, increasing photosynthesis. The engineered plants also had an increase in above-ground biomass of up to 52% compared to controls. The study was published in *Nature Plants*. [Read the press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200810113213.htm).


[***E. Coli***](https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(20)30363-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2451929420303636%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)[ **Gets a 21st Amino Acid**](https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(20)30363-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2451929420303636%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) **(Open Access)**

The [Xiao lab](https://xiao.rice.edu/) at Rice University has engineered *E. coli* to both synthesize a 21st amino acid (5-hydroxyl-tryptophan, or 5HTP) and then site-specifically incorporate it into proteins. The team then used the engineered cell to “serve as a living indicator for reactive oxygen species”, as stated by Xiao in a Rice [press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161331.htm). The work was published in *Chem*.
