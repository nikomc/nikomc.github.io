title: This Week in Synthetic Biology
---

Every week, I share the latest synthetic biology research articles, news stories, and interviews on the field. This is an effort to somewhat consolidate updates in the synthetic biology world, but is in no way original. This project is very much inspired by [Microbiome Digest](https://microbiomedigest.com/).
