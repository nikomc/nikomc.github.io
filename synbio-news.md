### [Synthetic Spider Silk](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0167-7799%2820%2930244-4) (Review)

Every once in awhile, a review comes along that makes me fall in love (again). I‚Äôve always been intrigued by synthetic spider silk, but a review from [Eriko Takano‚Äôs](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/eriko.takano.html) group, at the University of Manchester, has taken my obsession to new heights. This new review explores all the wondrous ways that living organisms‚Äîincluding, but not limited to, spiders‚Äîcan be coaxed into producing synthetic silk. Takano and the other authors offer an exciting scientific journey through the challenges of producing, and harvesting, silk spidroin proteins from *Salmonella* bacteria, mammalian cells, rice (!), other plants (including *Nicotiana tabacum*) and even mice. I didn‚Äôt know that so many different critters could produce silk, nor did I understand just how big of a factor pH plays in the silk spinning process within a spider‚Äôs glands. This review, which is open access, was published in *Trends in Biotechnology*. [Link](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0167-7799%2820%2930244-4)

### Synthetic Morphogen Gradients Come of Age

Two back-to-back studies, published in the Oct. 16 issue of *Science*, have demonstrated tunable, synthetic morphogen gradients‚Äîone in an *in vitro* system, and the other in living fruit flies. 

As a multicellular organism, such as the humble fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*), develops, each cell needs to be directed, much like a player in a symphony. In many cases, a cell‚Äôs final role is assigned, during development, based on the local concentration of a small molecule. Many of these small molecules have fun or threatening names, like ‚Äúsonic hedgehog‚Äù or the tongue-twisting ‚Äúbone morphogenetic protein‚Äìtransforming growth factor‚Äìb. 

If a morphogen‚Äôs concentration is high near one cell, for example, that cell might become a wing. Cells located within a *low morphogen* gradient, on the other hand, might become, say, an antennae.

By building synthetic morphogen gradients that can be *engineered* and *controlled*, scientists are able to better understand how morphogen gradients work, how organisms develop, and how different, quantitative factors result in different developmental outcomes.

In the first study, by Toda *et al.*, ([Link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/327)) green fluorescent protein (GFP) was, itself, converted into a morphogen. The researchers designed three cells; a ‚Äòsender‚Äô cell that produces the GFP morphogen, ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô cells that possess a synthetic Notch receptor that actually senses the GFP, and a so-called ‚Äòanchor‚Äô cell that captures GFP molecules and presents them to the receivers. When the synthetic Notch receptor on the ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô cell is presented with a GFP molecule, it can turn genes within the cell ON or OFF. It‚Äôs quite a complicated experiment, I know, but bear with me.

By designing and building each of these cells, the researchers were able to *tweak* the morphogen gradient‚Äôs parameters to study how, say, the amount of GFP produced, or the affinity between GFP and the receiver cells, impacts the morphogen gradient‚Äôs pattern. In the first study, their synthetic morphogen system was tested in an ‚Äúin vitro model of L929 fibroblast cells‚Äù. Using the three cell types, the team was able to create a ‚Äúpropagating wave of patterning‚Äù very similar to the morphogen gradient observed in a fruit fly‚Äôs eyeball during development. The team also implemented more complicated gradient patterns that involved the diffusion of two morphogens (GFP and a red fluorescent protein) simultaneously.

The second study, by Stapornwongkul, *et al.* ([Link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/321)), took this work a bit further, and studied a synthetic morphogen gradient‚Äîagain with GFP‚Äîdirectly in the ‚Äúwing imaginal disc of *D. melanogaster*‚Äù. By studying a synthetic morphogen gradient, with tunable properties, in a living organism, the scientists were able to systematically explore the complex molecular dance that underpins multicellular development.

For a deeper dive on these studies, I highly recommend reading the *Perspectives* piece, also published in the Oct. 16 issue of *Science*. [Link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6514/292) (none of these links are open access, unfortunately).

### [Mini Cannonballs, Grown & Tweaked Inside of Cells](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202004813)

Some organisms produce iron oxide nanoparticles, which are basically balls of magnetite (Fe3O4) that range in diameter from 1 to 100 nanometers. The applications for these ‚Äúminiature cannonballs‚Äù (not a real scientific term, I assure you) are immense: they can be used as contrast agents for MRI, for example, or as gene carriers for genetic therapies.  But, until now, it has been tough to coax cells‚Äîlike [*M. magneticum*](https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Magnetospirillum_magneticum)*‚Äî*into producing iron oxide nanoparticles of a consistent size. 

A new study, from [Chris Voigt‚Äôs group](http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/) at MIT, has developed a ‚Äúgenetically tunable‚Äù system for iron oxide nanoparticle production in *M. magneticum* cells. They developed a number of genetic parts‚Äîribosome binding sites, promoters, and other components‚Äîthat could be used to precisely tune those genes involved in producing these ‚Äúmini cannonballs‚Äù. They were able to tune the size, morphology, and even surface coatings of the iron oxide nanoparticles. This study was published in *Advanced Functional Materials*.

### [The Mystery of Overlapping Genes in Phages](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00323)

One of the wonders of viruses is that a *lot* of features can be packed into an itty-bitty genome. The sum total genetic information of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for example, consists of a measly 30,000 base pairs. For context, that‚Äôs 1/100,000th of the size of the human genome. And yet, SARS-CoV-2 can wreak utter destruction on the human body. 

Bacteria have their own set of viruses‚Äîor bacteriophages‚Äîto contend with. Bacteriophages, it turns out, *also* pack a massive punch in a small genome, and have a number of genes that *overlap* with one another (in other words, parts of genes are encoded inside of other genes). A new study has shown that, if you synthetically remove all of these overlapping regions in the œÜX174 genome, a type of phage that infects bacteria, the phages are not able to attach to bacterial cells as well and, even if they do infect a host, the number of new phages that they can create are drastically reduced. In other words, for some intriguing reason, overlapping genes *increase* the potency of a bacteriophage. This study was published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*.

* An online calculator can perform ‚Äútechno-economic analysis‚Äù for scaling up a metabolic engineering project. Specifically, the calculator computes the ‚Äúimpact of fermentation level metrics on the commercial potential of a bioprocess for the production of a wide variety of organic molecules.‚Äù It is called the *BioProcess TEA* calculator, is freely available, and was developed by Michael Lynch at Duke University. *bioRxiv* (*Open Access*). [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.331272v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=) & [Calculator](http://bioprocess-tea-calculator.herokuapp.com/)
* A wide-ranging perspective, from Ron Milo‚Äôs group at the Weizmann Institute, looks at carbon dioxide conversion in engineered organisms, especially algae, and how they can be used to feed a growing population. *Cell Reports Physical Science* (*Open Access*). [Link](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(20)30238-1#%20)
* Even genetically identical cells behave differently, and so tools that probe metabolic flux, in single cells, are very desirable. A new study reports an RNA-based sensor for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, an intermediate product in glycolysis, that ‚Äúcan be used to sense the glycolytic rate in single cells.‚Äù *bioRxiv* (*Open Access*). [Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.335109v1)
* Mikhail Shapiro‚Äôs group, at Caltech, has been at the forefront of synthetic biology and *in vivo* ultrasound technologies. Now, they‚Äôve written a review that is very much worth your time; it covers the basic science behind ultrasound and discusses how engineered microbes can be used for *in vivo* imaging. *Neuron* (*Open Access*). [Link](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30703-0)
* To determine a protein‚Äôs identity, within a cell, researchers often turn to an incredibly laborious method called [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry). A new study presents a method to fuse proteins to their mRNA transcript, enabling *nucleic acid sequencing* to be used for protein identification. This method could revolutionize proteomics. *PNAS* (*Open Access*). [Link](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/08/2002650117)
* Plants around the world produce thousands of different benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (yes, that‚Äôs a mouthful), chemical compounds that are widely used as antibacterial and anticancer drugs. Metabolic engineers have long been interested in producing these compounds in *living yeast cells*. Unfortunately, one of the enzymes that is required to produce these alkaloids‚Äîcalled norcoclaurine synthase‚Äîis toxic when present in the cytosol of yeast cells. A new study has found that, by targeting this enzyme to the peroxisome compartment, toxicity is reduced and titers for producing the alkaloids can be increased. *Nature Chemical Biology*. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-00668-4)
* I did not know this, but Vitamin E compounds can actually consist of eight different molecules; four *tocotrienols* and four *tocopherols* (which differ in their chemical structures). It turns out that *tocotrienols* can have really important health benefits, but are often left out of Vitamin E supplements. Now, a new study has engineered Baker‚Äôs yeast to produce tocotrienols by supplementing some native metabolic pathways in yeast with genes taken from photosynthetic organisms. *Nature Communications* (*Open Access*). [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18958-9)
* GFP is great to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù the insides of cells, but it has a problem: fluorescent proteins, in many cases, take several minutes to mature, or produce light, after they are produced in a cell. A new study has remedied this problem, reporting a ‚Äúgenetically encoded fluorescent biosensor‚Äù that, amazingly, enables the ‚Äúdetection of protein expression within seconds in live bacteria.‚Äù *ACS Synthetic Biology*. [Link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00407)
* A new study has, to some degree, standardized how genes can be expressed in cell-free systems. A paper from scientists at [LanzaTech](https://www.lanzatech.com/) and Northwestern University reports a ‚Äúmodular vector system that allows for T7 expression of desired enzymes for cell-free expression and direct Golden Gate assembly into *Clostridium* expression vectors.‚Äù The new system enables scientists to quickly test genes in cell-free extracts, and then export those designs to living cells. *Synthetic Biology* (*Open Access*). [Link](https://academic.oup.com/synbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/synbio/ysaa019/5923307)
* Plants, it turns out, are really good at producing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A new study has produced ‚Äúmilligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in *Nicotiana benthamiana*.‚Äù *bioRxiv* (*Open Access*).
